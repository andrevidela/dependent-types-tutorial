# Lists, Vectors and Matrices

In this file, we are going to be using dependent types toward implementing lists, vectors
and functions on them in order to experience the benefits of a rich type system. We start
with some imports:

```idris
module File1

import Data.Nat
import Data.Vect
import Data.Fin
```

The definition of `Nat` `Vect` and `Fin` is as we wrote in [File 0][FILE0]



[FILE0]: src/File0.md
[FILE1]: src/File1.md
[FILE2]: src/File2.md
[FILE3]: src/File3.md
[FILE4]: src/File4.md
